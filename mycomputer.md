## My Relationship With My Computer:
**I'm really happy with my computer. Recently I've been using it for schoolwork only and there's nothing wrong with it and it does everything well. I've had it for around 6 years since I bought it in London when I was traveling, right before 5th grade started. I've never dropped it or broken it in anyway since I got it.**
## How My Computer's Performance is Affected By Its Hardware Configuration
**My computer starts to heat up and slow down when I play games on my laptop. I think this is because of the CPU, the CPU processes data and the output of games slower than the latest laptop with a better CPU. So games I've dowloaded on my laptop will be slow and get my laptop to heat up if the game is too big and has a lot of data. **
