## My Relationship With My Computer:
   **I'm really happy with my computer. Recently I've been using it for schoolwork only and there's nothing wrong with it and it does everything well. I've had it for around 6 years since I bought it in London when I was traveling, right before 5th grade started. I've never dropped it or broken it in anyway since I got it.**
## How My Computer's Performance is Affected By Its Hardware Configuration
#### *CPU*

**My computer starts to heat up and slow down when I play games on my laptop. I think this is because of the CPU, the CPU processes data and the output of games slower than the latest laptop with a better CPU, mine is only 1.6hz while there are many higher ones today. So games I've dowloaded on my laptop will be slow and get my laptop to heat up if the game is too big and has a lot of data.** 
#### *Wi-Fi*

**My Laptop sometimes slows down due to the Wi-fi. My laptops's Wi-fi is 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible. 802.11ac Wi-fi means that it runs at. It is Wi-Fi 5, and there is something called Wi-Fi 6 which is faster. Most laptops and routers have Wi-Fi 5. I've never had much problems with my Wi-Fi on my computer, but if my brother starts playing video games while I'm studying then the websites start to load slower and at times it goes completely and takes more than 30 seconds to load a website. When my Wi-Fi slows down, my laptop does too.**

#### *RAM*

**My laptops starts to slow down sometimes because of the RAM. My laptop's RAM is 8GB which is the average RAM you find on a laptop. Meanwhile MacBook Pros come with 16 GB RAM and Gameing laptops come with 16, 32, and 64GB of Ram. The issue that is caused by the 8GB RAM is when I have many things open, and I start switching between them. This starts slowing down my laptop as too many things are open to be controlled by the RAM which is faster and the data inside easily accesible but temporary storage, so when full my laptop will slow down as it will be overloaded and won't be able to hold all the data, and will began circulating the data using the hard disk so that it can keep up with what I'm doing, and as a result it makes my laptop slower.  **
