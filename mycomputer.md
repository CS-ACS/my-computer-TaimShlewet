## My Relationship With My Computer:
**I'm really happy with my computer. Recently I've been using it for schoolwork only and there's nothing wrong with it and it does everything well. I've had it for around 6 years since I bought it in London when I was traveling, right before 5th grade started. I've never dropped it or broken it in anyway since I got it.**
